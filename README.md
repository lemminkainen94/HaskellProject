# HaskellProject

Simplified C-like language interpreter written in Haskell for a course from my 3rd year of BSc in CS.

The language has several features, like:

-static binding and typing

-functions

-recursion

-loops

-two simple data types: int and bool

-structures and arrays of int and bool

You can compile it with make and then interpret *wo files with ./Main path/to/wo/file.
Sample source code which should be interpreted without errors is in dobre/
Sample source code which should run with errors is in z≈Çe/
